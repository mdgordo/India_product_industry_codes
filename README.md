Converted National Product Classification Scheme and National Industrial Codes from PDF to excel tables

India's Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) microdata is an amazing resource for researchers. Unfortunately, the documentation files for the National Industry Classification (NIC) and the National Product Classification Scheme (NPCS) are in pdf format making them difficult to use. I used tabula (https://tabula.technology/) to convert these pdfs into excel tables that I hope will be useful to others. 

This repository contains the original pdf files and the converted excel files. I'm sure there are mistakes, in particular the NIC file is quite messy, so feel free to contribute and fix them.
